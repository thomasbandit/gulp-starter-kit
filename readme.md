# A Simple Gulp starter kit

A simple Gulp starter kit including:

- ES6/Babel 6
- Inline assets (Minified CSS and JavaScript inserted into the HTML documents)
- HTML minification
- Image optimisation
- SCSS compilation
- SVG Sprite handling
- Webpack for JavaScript compilation.

## Usage
- `npm run dev` - Watches all assets and provides a live-reload server available at <http://localhost:3000/>
